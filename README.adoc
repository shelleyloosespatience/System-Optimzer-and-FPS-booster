== Credits

This project is brought to you by **@me_straight**.

PS: I'm not too good with Python—I rock more in JavaScript, Rust, and web development. So if you see any way to improve the Python code, I'd seriously appreciate your help! :3

== Animations & Interactivity

For those who crave more than static documentation, consider using HTML/CSS/JavaScript to embed animations directly into your docs. Tools like Reveal.js can transform your docs into interactive presentations, and since AsciiDoc can be converted to HTML, you can easily add custom animations and dynamic effects. Enjoy mixing code with cool visuals!

Happy gaming and happy coding!
